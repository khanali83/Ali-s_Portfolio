    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
        Hello! I'm <strong>Ali Khan</strong>, a passionate and dedicated <strong>Tech Savvy Professional</strong> with expertise in web development, app development, and data analytics. My journey in the tech industry began with a desire to solve real-world problems using cutting-edge technologies. Over the years, I've honed my skills in both front-end and back-end development, constantly expanding my knowledge in Artificial Intelligence (AI), Machine Learning (ML), and Deep Learning (DL).
    </p>
    <p>
        One of my most recent accomplishments is creating an <strong>image recognition bot</strong>, a project that leverages AI to interpret images, classify objects, and provide insightful feedback. My technical expertise also includes IoT projects like the <strong>SolarSmart Adjuster</strong>, where I designed a system that optimally adjusts solar panels for maximum energy efficiency using servo motors and smart sensors.
    </p>
    <p>
        In addition to my strong technical skills, I’m an advocate of critical thinking and problem-solving. I’ve built multiple successful projects such as a <strong>food ordering system</strong>, an <strong>e-commerce website</strong>, and a fully functional <strong>Learning Management System</strong>, demonstrating my ability to deliver robust and scalable solutions.
    </p>
    <p>
        With a passion for continuous learning, I aim to bridge the gap between technology and business by providing innovative solutions. I look forward to collaborating with organizations that challenge the status quo and push the boundaries of what technology can achieve.
